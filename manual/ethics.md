title: Research ethics
---

Our actions should be guided by the ethics of participating in the scientific
community.
This means:

* Prioritizing our professional obligations over fear of being "scooped." For
  instance, it is unacceptable to interfere with the peer-review process for a
  paper out of concern of protecting one's own work (i.e., "sitting" on a
  review for it, making unreasonable requests to delay publication, and so on.)
* When other researchers request assistance with software developed in the lab,
  we should attempt to make a best effort to assist them. It is not
  unreasonable to ask for authorship, particularly if the collaboration is
  extensive.
* Provide citations to all software that assisted in the development of the
  scholarly work. In general it is acceptable to cite the layers of software in
  the analysis stack (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython/Jupyter, Fatiando, etc.)
* Citations to data sources (DOIs and publications) should be made wherever
  possible, and where not possible, should be included as footnotes.
* Plagiarism is unacceptable in any form. This includes "first pass" text
  included in papers or proposals. If including text from an external source,
  it must be clearly marked as such to ensure it is not accidentally included
  in the final product.

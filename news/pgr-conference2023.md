Lab member [India Uppal](../team#indiauppal) had her first poster presentation
at this year's PGR Conference of the School of Environmental Science,
University of Liverpool.
India showed everyone the progress made on her PhD thesis so far, in which we
are investigating the use of the *equivalent sources method* to convert
observations of total-field magnetic anomaly into the amplitude of the
anomalous magnetic field (I know, they sound the same but they really are not).
Our goal is to apply this to the available magnetic data for Antarctica to
produce a uniform data grid that is less sensitive to the changes in direction
of the geomagnetic field.

this topic!**

The conversion between data types is not perfect but it's close enough to show real promise.") }}

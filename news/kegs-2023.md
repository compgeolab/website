A few weeks ago, [Santiago](../team#santisoler) gave a talk at the [KEGS 2023
Symposium](https://www.kegsonline.org/KEGS-2023-Symposium) that introduced to
the Canadian geophysical community some of the latest developments in the
[Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) open-source project.

## Abstract

The [Fatiando a Terra project](https://www.fatiando.org) is a collection of
open-source Python libraries for geophysics that covers a wide range of
functionalities, from data download and processing to modelling and inversion.
Each one of the libraries in the project was designed with their own scope of
applications.

Harmonica is focused on processing and modelling gravity and magnetic data. It
provides tools for gravity corrections like Bouguer and terrain effects;
interpolations and upward continuation through equivalent sources; Fourier
domain filters like vertical derivatives, upward continuation and reduction to
the pole; forward modelling of geometries like prisms, point sources and
tesseroids (a.k.a spherical prisms); and more. Boule hosts reference ellipsoids
useful for applying coordinate conversions and normal gravity calculations.
Verde offers tools for processing and interpolating any type of spatial data
through a diverse set of methods, with a machine learning inspired approach.
Pooch eases the process of downloading and caching data from the web with a
very simple interface. Lastly, Ensaio offers a set of curated open-licensed
datasets useful for teaching, practicing and probing our codes.

The project started in 2010 in South America as a simple Python library as part
of a PhD Thesis, and has since growth to include a global community of
contributors. Its progress has been facilitated by a consistent effort of
meeting the highest standards in software development. Through the adoption of
best practices and a thoughtful design of its tools, the project provides well
tested and well documented code that is easy to use, regardless of the Python
skills of its users. This has led the project to be used in real world
applications like scientific research and geophysical exploration within
industry and academia.

During this talk we'll provide an overview of the tools in the Fatiando
project, demonstrate their functionalities using examples from research and
industry applications, and take a look at some code snippets to showcase its
capabilities and ease of use. We will also take the opportunity to discuss
upcoming developments, our roadmap for the future and plans for implementing
highly requested features.

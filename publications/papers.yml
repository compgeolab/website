      The equivalent source technique is a powerful and widely used method for
      processing gravity and magnetic data. Nevertheless, its major drawback is
      the large computational cost in terms of processing time and computer
      memory. We present two techniques for reducing the computational cost of
      equivalent source processing: block-averaging source locations and the
      gradient-boosted equivalent source algorithm. Through block-averaging,
      we reduce the number of source coefficients that must be estimated
      while retaining the minimum desired resolution in the final processed
      data. With the gradient boosting method, we estimate the sources
      coefficients in small batches along overlapping windows, allowing us to
      reduce the computer memory requirements arbitrarily to conform to the
      constraints of the available hardware. We show that the combination of
      block-averaging and gradient-boosted equivalent sources is capable of
      producing accurate interpolations through tests against synthetic data.
      Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by gridding a
      gravity dataset covering Australia with over 1.7 million observations
      using a modest personal computer.

      This research was done entirely with open-source software and open data!
      This means that anyone should be able to fully reproduce our results
      using the information in the paper and the material in the associated
      GitHub repository. This is the final part of Santiago's PhD thesis.

      The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and
      Ocean sciences. As a cross-platform tool producing high quality maps and
      figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world.
      The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s,
      despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning
      curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike.
      Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break
      compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT
      version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new "modern mode" to
      complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls
      "classic mode". GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended
      upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage
      of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used
      global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw
      subplots, place insets, and create animations.

      This paper marks the release of GMT version 6. Most of the work done for
      this release had the goal of reducing barriers to entry for new users.
      The user experience as a whole has been improved and these changes are
      the foundation for my work on PyGMT. The development of the new modern
      mode was funded by our NSF EarthScope grant.

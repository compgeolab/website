title: "Royal Society grant to work on magnetic microscopy 🧲🔬"
date: 2022-03-31

The lab has just been awarded an International Exchange grant by the
[Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/)! 🥳

The award titled "Towards individual-grain paleomagnetism: Translating
regional-scale geophysics to the nascent field of magnetic microscopy"
intends to establish a new partnership between the CompGeoLab and the
Paleomagnetism Lab of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, led by
[Prof. Ricardo I. F. Trindade](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ricardo-Trindade).
It will fund bi-directional travel between Liverpool and São Paulo for
myself, Ricardo, and PhD student [Gelson](/news/new-members-2021.html).

I'm thrilled to be able to work closely with this group, which is where I
[got my first taste of research as an undergraduate](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4779769)!

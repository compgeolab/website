The lab manual outlines our principles, expectations, guidelines, on-boarding
process, and general information about how we operate as a research team.

</div>

## About

This document is designed to be a reference for lab members and collaborators,
explaining how we work and what are our expectations.
It's divided into two sections:

* **{{ page.toc[0].title }}:** Lays out our core principles and work ethic.
* **{{ page.toc[1].title }}:** Explains of how we operate and other useful
  information.

The manual is a **living document.** Lab members are encouraged to submit
**fixes and improvements** to it. See the
[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/compgeolab/website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for this website to find out how.

**Want to work with us?**
Before applying to join the lab or starting a collaboration, please

These sections outline our core principles as scientists and it's important
that you are aware of and agree with these principles to a large extent.

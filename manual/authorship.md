title: Authorship policy
---

<div class="lead">

These are our guidelines around authorship on papers, grants, software, and
elsewhere. They are founded on principles of openness and collaboration.

</div>

## General principles

* **We do not view authorship as a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game)**.
* Authorship in publications should be explicitly discussed between everyone
  involved **as early as possible**, ideally as soon as a project starts.
* Projects that lab members bring with them **do not** automatically confer
  authorship rights to either Leo or other lab members.
* However, if work is conducted on them during the course of being present in
  the lab, acknowledgments would be appreciated (funding acknowledgments are
  necessary).
* Projects that are collaborated on between lab members confer authorship to
  those directly involved, whether that collaboration is intellectual,
  technical, or data sharing. For example, writing code to support analysis or
  simulation would confer authorship.
* Sharing information during group meetings does not automatically confer
  authorship.
* If material intellectual contributions (i.e., new directions, solutions to
  problems, specific and directed project ideas) are made by lab members, that
  would confer authorship.
* Please keep Leo apprised of the broad outlines of your external and internal
  collaborations.
* You do not have to involve Leo or grant him authorship in your external
  collaborations.

## Software papers and software archives

We strive to give appropriate credit to contributors for their work on software
projects led by lab members. To do so, we will attempt to define:

- Fair and diverse ways of providing recognition for contributors' efforts.
- Define _contributions_ in a broad way: writing code and/or documentation,
  providing ideas, fostering the community, etc.

The following are the ways in which individuals who have contributed will be
recognized.

**Note:**
These guidelines are based on the
[Fatiando a Terra authorship guidelines](https://github.com/fatiando/community/blob/main/AUTHORSHIP.md).

### Changelog for each release

Every time we make a release, everyone who has made a commit to the software
repository since the previous release will be mentioned in the changelog entry.
This is a way of saying "Thank you".

### The AUTHORS file

Anyone who has contributed a pull request to the project is welcome to **add
themselves to the `AUTHORS.md` file**. This file lives in the repository and is
packaged with distributions.

This is an optional process and is **opt-in**. Names and affiliations will be
sourced from this file for publishing source code archives.

### Zenodo archives of releases

Anyone who has contributed to the repository (i.e., appears on `git log`) can
be included as an author on the Zenodo source code archive of new releases.

To be included as an author, you must add the following to the `AUTHORS.md`
file of the repository:

1. Full name
2. Affiliation (if omitted, we will use "Unaffiliated")
3. ORCID (optional)

If you have contributed and **do not wish to be included** in Zenodo archives,
there are a few options:

1. Don't add yourself to `AUTHORS.md`
2. Remove yourself from `AUTHORS.md`
3. Indicate next to your name on `AUTHORS.md` that you do not wish to be
   included with something like `(not included in Zenodo)`.

### Scientific publications (papers)

We aim to write academic papers for most of your software packages. Ideally, we
will publish updated papers for major changes or large new components of the
package.

To be included as an author on the paper, you must satisfy the following
criteria:

1. Have made a contribution to the repository or significant non-coding
   contributions.
2. Add your full name, affiliation, and ORCID to the paper. These can be
   submitted by pull requests to the corresponding paper repository.
3. Write and/or read and review the manuscript in a timely manner and provide
   comments on the paper (even if it's just an "OK", but preferably more).

The order of authors will be decided on a case-by-case basis by open discussion
with the authors.

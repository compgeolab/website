The 2022 edition of the
[Transform virtual conference](https://transform.softwareunderground.org)
is happening in this week!
This year, I'm teaching a workshop on mid-ocean ridges that makes use of
several of the [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) packages and
[PyGMT](https://www.pygmt.org).

There is no registration and the workshop is [freely available on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzJmRlJCNbQ):

The workshop materials and instructions are available on GitHub:
[compgeolab/transform2022](https://github.com/compgeolab/transform2022).
As always, everything is open-source under permissive licenses so you can
reuse, remix, and share this content to your heart's content!

Join us on the [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/) Slack
for discussions and support during and after the tutorial. There are many more
tutorials to watch!

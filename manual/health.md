# Health is important

**Your first priority should always be your own health, safety and well-being.**

No project, paper, grant or collaboration exists that is more important than you.

In particular, time as a graduate students and as a postdoc is known to be a time that
causes undue stress, resulting in consequences ranging from mild to extremely severe.

Quoting from the article
[Graduate School Can Have Terrible Effects on People's Mental Health](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/anxiety-depression-mental-health-graduate-school/576769/):

> The doctoral-degree experience often consists of intense labor expectations for little
> pay and a resulting lack of sleep and social life. In addition, there is the notorious
> hierarchy of academia, which often promotes power struggles and tribalism. … Graduate
> students are disproportionately likely to struggle with mental-health issues. The
> researchers surveyed roughly 500 economics Ph.D. candidates at eight elite
> universities, and found that 18 percent of them experienced moderate or severe
> symptoms of depression and anxiety. That's more than three times the national average,
> according to the study.

This month, lab members  Lottie Cooper, Steven Heer, Alexander Borges, and
Charles Thomson have successfully finished their dissertations and have all
graduated from the University of Liverpool! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ All four have received high
marks for their work and Steven received an award for his dissertation.

I'm, of course, extremely proud of them all. It was a pleasure to get to know
them throughout the year and I've learned a lot along the way.
Their arrival is what motivated the creation of the
[lab manual](https://github.com/compgeolab/manual) and
their work is providing a model for a
[dissertation template](https://github.com/compgeolab/dissertation-template)
that will facilitate the on-boarding of new members in the 2020/21 cohort.

**Please join me in wishing the new geophysicists all the best in their future
careers and lives in general!** ðŸ¥‚

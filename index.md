## About

The **CompGeoLab** is a research group based at the
[{{ config.location.university }}'s {{ config.location.school }}][uol].
We are experts in solving **inverse problems** in the field of **Geophysics**.
For example, determining the inner density distribution of the Earth from
measured disturbances in the Earth's gravity field.
These are the main tools used by geoscientists to **image the inside** of the
Earth and other planets.

<div class="lead">

**We have an open-by-default policy**, meaning that we assume that software and
data will be made openly available under permissive licenses
([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0),
[BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), etc.)
unless there is a  **very** good reason not to
(like [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information)
or other restrictions).

## General guidelines on openness

* Work on software should be conducted in **public repositories**.
* Papers, dissertations, and research projects may be held back as private
  until time of first submission, when they **must be made public for
  peer-review**.
* Because most repositories will be made publicly accessible, including their
  entire history, lab members are required to **behave professionally** in them
  (including commit messages, issues, pull requests, code comments, etc).
* Many journals consider the content of referee reports to be confidential.
  Unless the report is explicitly open, it **should not be added** to
  repositories as text, commit messages, or comments in papers.
* Grant proposals developed internally with no external PIs or Co-PIs should be
  made open unless there is confidential information.
* Grant proposals developed in collaboration with external PIs or Co-PIs may be
  kept confidential at the external collaborators discretion, although our
  preference is for them to be open.

## Data and code availability

* All data and models generated by the lab will be made available in both raw
  and processed forms under
  [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or
  [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) licenses.
* All software will be made available in source form under permissive,
  BSD-style licenses, unless constrained by external copyleft licensing.
* Source code will be made publicly available on GitHub (or similar),
  with additional archives on longer-term preservation platforms like
  [figshare](https://figshare.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
* **Every effort will be made to preserve integrity and accessibility of data.**

## Reproducibility

* **All necessary components** to provide reproducibility of a scholarly work
  should be provided in a **publicly accessible location**, as **part of the
  scientific record** (e.g., by including DOIs to data archives in papers),
  and distributed under an appropriate **open license**.
* The only exception is when strongly prohibited by external concerns (private
  or sensitive data, etc).
* Method development papers **must include**:
  1. The source code that implements the methodology.
  1. Analysis code that generated plots and results from the paper.
* The additional overhead of making work reproducible should not be onerous
  compared to the other expectations, and can actually reduce the overall
  effort of developing papers and workflows.
* We will endeavor to respond to requests to reproduce our results by providing
  necessary technology and data, allowing for reasonable commitments of time
  and effort.

We focus our efforts on creating and applying new methods for **3D modeling and
data processing**, mostly for gravimetry and magnetometry.

## Magnetic microscopy

The magnetization locked in minerals at the time of their formation is a
gateway to the **Earth's distant past**.
So far, researchers have only been able to make bulk measurements from each
sample.
Magnetic microscopy technology is now allowing us to distinguish **the magnetic
fields of the individual minerals** that make up the rock sample.
Our group is working with experts in paleomagnetism to **develop new methods**
that are capable of unlocking the huge potential of these new data.

## Antarctic geothermal heat flow

Heat flow from the Earth's interior is an important parameter for how **ice
sheets flow** and how the Earth's crust rebounds upwards once ice mass is
displaced, influencing **sea-level rise**.
Magnetic anomaly data is one of the few ways we have to determine heat flow.
Our group is working to improve the way **airborne and satellite magnetic
data** are merged and modelled to produce heat flow estimates.

## Machine learning & data processing

It's undeniable that a **machine learning** frenzy has taken over the world.
Geoscientists have been doing similar things for decades, for example the
**equivalent sources technique** in gravity and magnetics is basically a
supervised-learning method. Given the many similarities, we are applying and
adapting machine learning techniques and best-practices to geophysical
problems.

There are different ways to use uncertainties as data weights for processing.") }}

## Geophysical inversion and imaging

Our ultimate goal as geophysicists is to **understand the inner structure and
dynamics of the Earth** from surface observations. This is a tough mathematical
and computational problem: an ill-posed **inverse problem**, to which a
solution might not exist or be non-unique and unstable.
We develop methods to overcome these challenges and solve different kinds of
inverse problems that arise in geophysics.

</div>


## Forward modeling

A key component for solving an inverse problem is first solve the **forward
problem** (predicting observed data from a known model of the subsurface).
One of our main research themes is the development methods for
forward modeling **gravitational fields** caused by a tesseroid (a segment of a
sphere).
This is a surprisingly difficult task but is crucial to model geology at
continental and global scales.

**This month**, [Arthur Siqueira de Macêdo](../team#arthursmacedo) and I had the opportunity to present our MSc projects at the **IAG | Science Day**. This event gathers members of the IAG for **5-minute presentations**, where researchers give concise summaries of their work to a broad audience from our institute. It was a **challenging** but interesting experience, as we’re not used to delivering such brief presentations, but it pushed us to communicate our ideas **clearly and efficiently**.

## Arthur
On April 4th, 2025, Arthur presented his MSc seminar at the **Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP)**, part of the University of São Paulo. My research, titled **Integration of airborne geophysics datasets with equivalent sources on the sphere**, focuses on developing and applying novel methods for integrating airborne geophysical data using equivalent source techniques on a spherical surface.

The motivation behind this work lies in the increasing availability of regional and global geophysical surveys, which often differ in resolution, coverage, and acquisition parameters. Traditional approaches struggle to reconcile these differences, especially when working at continental scales. By using equivalent sources defined on a spherical geometry, my methodology enables more consistent and accurate integration of these datasets, preserving the physical meaning of the data. Throughout the project, I implemented and tested this approach on synthetic datasets, demonstrating its potential to support applications in geological mapping and crustal structure studies.


## Yago
On April 15 2025, Yago gave a MSc seminar presentation at the **Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP)** of the University of São Paulo, presenting the development progress of **Magali**, a Python library for magnetic microscopy data processing.

Magali is designed as an open-source computational tool for **magnetic microscopy data analysis**, featuring:
- Data transformation capabilities
- Automated particle identification in microscopy images
- Magnetic dipole moment inversion algorithms

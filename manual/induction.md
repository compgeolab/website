title: On-boarding
---

When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a meeting with Leo to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc. **If you don't hear from Leo within a week of
starting, please remind him by email.**

Leo's to-do list:

* Send invitation to the group chat room.
* Add to the [lab GitHub organization][gh].

**Before** your meeting with Leo:

* Join the chat room and setup [Element](https://element.io/) on your computer/tablet/phone.
* Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* Send Leo a message with your GitHub username.

**During** your meeting, go over key information about:

* The [lab website][website] and how you can add yourself to it.
* The [lab GitHub organization][gh] where all our research projects live.
* The lab manual, expectations, and practices.

**After** your meeting:

* Read the [Code of Conduct][coc] carefully.
* Add yourself to the website (if you want). See the [Contributing Guide][website-contrib] for instructions.
* Go over the lab manual again on your own.
* Study the [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons on Version Control with Git, Python, and the Unix Shell. They will be crucial for your project. Go over Git and the Unix Shell first.
* Explore the GitHub organization to see what the group is working on.
* Go and start making something brilliant!

title: Joining the lab

{% import "macros.html" as macros %}

<div class="lead">

The lab is based primarily at the {{ config.location.school }} of
{{ config.location.university }}.
See below for opportunities to join the lab as a student or postdoc.

## Are we a match?

Interested in joining the lab?
The first and foremost thing we must determine
is **if we are a good match**.
Our goal is for the lab to be a relatively small group of people who work well
together and support each other.
This necessitates that we get along on a personal level and that we share the
same principles and ethics.
It also means that we will be able to provide the adequate support that each
member needs to achieve their career goals.

Please read {{ macros.page_link("manual/open-science", page, site) }} and
{{ macros.page_link("manual/authorship", page, site) }}.
These sections outline our core principles as scientists and it's important
that you are aware of and agree with these principles to a large extent.
You should also read {{ macros.page_link("manual/expectations", page, site)}}
to make sure you are aware of what we expect from lab members and what they can
expect from Leo.
These are things in which **we do not compromise**.

## What are we looking for?

Our research almost always involves a large amount of programming and numerical
methods.
This does not necessarily mean "software engineering" (though we do that too)
but every project will involve some Python programming for data analysis and
use of [GitHub](https://github.com/compgeolab).

We are interested in members from any degree programme, though we find that
people with prior experience in calculus, physics, and computer programming
have an easier time adjusting to the type of research we do.
**Don't worry if you don't have this experience.**
We can teach you technical things like maths, programming, and the like.
But we cannot provide you with the motivation to learn, grow, and execute
your project.
Therefore, **the most important characteristic we're looking for is curiosity
and motivation to learn independently**.

If this is you, then keep reading!

## Start a conversation

If you feel like we would be a good match, the first thing to do is to
[contact Leo](../team#leouieda) to see if he is able to take on more students
and postdocs and to arrange for a meeting.
We aim to foster a small and healthy research group, where everyone has the
time and support they need to thrive.
Unfortunately, this means that sometimes we cannot take on new members.

When writing to Leo to inquire about opportunities, please **mention specific
examples of things you'd like to work on**. What are your interests? What about
the group made you want to join? What are your career goals? You don't need to
have a concrete idea but it helps to demonstrate that you've looked at our
research and have given this some thought.

<div class="callout">

**What if you change your mind?**
In the lab, we believe that your career comes first.
Leo already has a degree and a stable job.
So your needs come first.
This means that if at any point you change your mind and want to pursue another
project or work under someone else's supervision, then you are free to do so
within reason
(for example, FAPESP scholarships are not so easily changed once started).
Leo will do everything he can to help in this transition and provide honest
advice.

## Opportunities

There are many sources of scholarships available to students and postdocs at
USP.
This includes opportunities for both **national and international applicants**.

### Undergraduate students

We welcome undergrads who want to undertake scientific initiation, outreach,
and dissertation/graduation projects with the lab.
The projects we can offer will vary and we are also open to ideas that you may
have!

There are several opportunities for scientific initiation scholarships which we
can pursue (PUB, PIBIC, FAPESP).
In general, students first **start working a small amount of hours on
a volunteer basis** to see if there is a good match with the lab before
applying for a scholarship.
This is because **scholarships are a commitment** that often must be fulfilled
once accepted.
We want to avoid a situation in which someone accepts a scholarship and then
realises that they do not want to do the work for whatever reason.


### Graduate students

Applications are handled by the
[Geophysics graduate program](https://www.iag.usp.br/pos-graduacao/geofisica)
at IAG.
However, please **speak with Leo before applying** if you're interested in
joining the lab.
This is a requirement for PhD students and highly encouraged for MSc students.
While MSc students can apply without having a supervisor, there is no guarantee
that the lab will be able to accommodate you even if you are offered a place in
the programme.

The programme has a good number of CAPES **scholarships** for both **national
and international students**.
There is no relocation funding so you'll have to make your way to SÃ£o Paulo
using your own funds.
We can also apply for [FAPESP scholarships](https://fapesp.br/bolsas), which
pay significantly more but are harder to get.
If this is something you want to do, then please let Leo know and we should
apply as soon as possible (even before you are officially accepted into the
graduate programme).

### Postdocs

FAPESP has the [best scholarships](https://fapesp.br/bolsas/pd) for postdocs
and accepts national and international applicants.
Their scholarships are very generous and are usually tax-free in Brazil.
There are other scholarships available from time to time so it's good to check
with Leo if there is anything that would suite you.

There is no entry requirements or selection process in the department for
postdocs. So it's mostly a matter of finding funding for a scholarship.
That said, postdocs are **expected to be independent researchers** and bring
their own project ideas.

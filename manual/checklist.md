When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a meeting with Leo to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc.

# Before your meeting

Please make sure the following have happened **before meeting Leo**:

1. Join the lab [Slack](https://slack.com/) chat room. Leo should send you and
   invitation. Please remind him if you don't get one.
1. Setup Slack on your computer/tablet/phone or use the website version:
   [compgeolab.slack.com](https://compgeolab.slack.com)
1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Make sure you remember
   your user name. Make it something professional (this will be associated with
   your future publications from the lab).

# During your meeting

You will be added to:

1. The lab GitHub organization
   ([github.com/compgeolab](https://github.com/compgeolab/)). All projects will
   be developed here.
1. Group Google calendar. Leo will put in shared events, meetings, conferences,
   and times when he'll be away.
1. This website. Each member gets a page in [/people]. **You can opt-out of
   having your page** if you don't want one. If you do want one, you can modify
   the contents at any time and add a (somewhat professional) photo if you'd
   like.
1. Leo's workstation for running your code. You'll have an account and be able
   to access it from any campus computer or using the university VPN.

The we'll go over this document:

1. Mental Health Resources
1. Code of Conduct
1. Expectations (what we expect from you, what you can expect from us)
1. Communication (email, Slack, GitHub, Jitsi Meet, etc)
1. Check-ins, feedback, and meetings
1. Computing resources

# After your meeting

1. Read the [Code of Conduct][/manual/coc] carefully.
1. Go over this document again on your own (ask on Slack if you have any
   questions).
1. Edit your page on the website (if you want). See the website [contributing
   guide](https://github.com/compgeolab/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   for instructions.
1. Explore the GitHub organization to see what the group is working on.
1. Study the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
   lessons on Version Control with Git, Python, and the Unix Shell. They will
   be crucial for your project.
1. Go and start making something brilliant!

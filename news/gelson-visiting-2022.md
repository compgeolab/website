This week we're getting started with phase 1 of our
[Royal Society grant to develop magnetic microscopy](rsoc-mag-microscopy-2022.html)
with the arrival of PhD student [Gelson Ferreira de Souza Junior](new-members-2021.html)
at Liverpool!

We'll be working hard to put the finishing touches on our first paper on the
subject, which is being led by Gelson.
It will describe how we're using a combination of image processing, traditional
aeromagnetic filtering and interpretation techniques, and some novel inversion
methods to recover the magnetic moment in a very fast and memory efficient way.
On top of that, we'll also start porting some of Gelson's prototype code
into [Fatiando a Terra](../software) and creating a new open-source library for
the parts that are specific to microscopy.
Lots of fun to be had!

As always, we'll publish a preprint to [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/)
and code on [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/compgeolab/) as soon
as we submit the paper.

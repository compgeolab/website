<div class="lead">

We focus our efforts on creating and applying new methods for **3D modeling and
data processing**, mostly for gravimetry and magnetometry (AKA
**potential-field methods**). Below, you'll find
the main research themes that we pursue.

## Magnetic microscopy

The magnetization that gets locked in some minerals (known as [*ferromagnetic minerals*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism)) at the time of their formation is one of a few gateways we have into the **Earth's distant past**.
So far, researchers have mostly only been able to make bulk measurements of magnetization from collected rock samples.
Emerging *magnetic microscopy* technology is now allowing us to image thin-sections and distinguish **the magnetic fields of the individual minerals** that make up the rock sample.

Our group is collaborating with experts in paleomagnetism to **develop new methods and software for data processing and interpretation**, unlocking the huge potential of these exciting new datasets.

## Antarctic geophysical data

Antarctica is a vast and poorly explored continent that is suffering greatly
from the impacts of human-induced climate change.
Geophysical data are crucial to understanding how Antarctica's **ice sheets
will respond to climate change** and how the Earth's crust rebounds upwards
once ice mass is displaced, influencing **sea-level rise**.

We are working hard on improving the way that **airborne and satellite**
gravity and magnetic data from Antarctica are processed and merged, aiming to
reach the highest resolution possible from the data.

The data coverage has a lot of gaps.", caption='The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078153">ADMAP2</a> compilation of open-access airborne magnetic anomaly data for Antarctica. We are improving the compilation by adding more recent surveys and standardizing the data, as well as developing a new process for merging these data with satellite observations.') }}

## Geophysical data processing and interpolation

It's undeniable that a **machine learning** frenzy has taken over the world.
Geoscientists have been doing similar things for decades, for example the **equivalent sources technique** in gravity and magnetics and **spline interpolation** are basically supervised-learning methods.
Given the many similarities, it makes sense to apply and adapt machine learning techniques and best-practices to these geophysical problems.

At the lab, we are employing machine-learning methods like **ensemble techniques** and **cross-validation** to overcome key computational challenges in equivalent-source methods and data interpolation (AKA gridding).

{{ macros.figure(src="../images/gradient-boosted-equivalent-sources-gravity.jpg", alt="Two maps side by side of the area, with coastlines visible on the upper part, the left map showing red-white-blue dots scattered throughout the continental part, the right map showing a continuous red-white-blue distribution of colors.", caption='Results from our interpolation of millions of <a href="https://github.com/compgeolab/australia-gravity-data">ground gravity data from Australia</a> to a uniform height using gradient-boosted equivalent sources. <strong>Left:</strong> Section of the ground measurements of gravity disturbance (red means positive and blue means negative) from several surveys with different spacings and distributions. <strong>Right:</strong> Same section of the interpolated grid at a uniform height, which is able to retain the high resolution of the denser surveys while filling in the gaps in the data.') }}

## 3D geophysical inverse problems

Our ultimate goal as geophysicists is to **understand the inner structure and dynamics of the Earth** from surface observations.
This is a tough mathematical and computational problem: it's an ill-posed **inverse problem**, to which a solution might not exist, not be unique, and not be stable.

We develop methods to overcome these challenges and solve different kinds of inverse problems that arise in geophysics.

## Forward modeling gravity and magnetic data

A key component for solving an inverse problem is first solve the **forward problem** (predicting observed data from a known model of the subsurface).
This is often a challenging problem to solve, both mathematically and computationally.
Having a forward model that is both **accurate and performant** is the key to a reliable solution to an inverse problem.

One of our earliest research themes is the development of methods and software for modeling **gravitational fields** caused by a tesseroid (a segment of a sphere).
This is a surprisingly difficult task but is crucial to model geology at continental and global scales.
We also produce software that can model different geometries, like points, spheres, prisms, polygons, etc.

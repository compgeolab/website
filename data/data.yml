    description: |
      Gravity data are among the most widely used means of investigating the
      depth to the crust-mantle boundary (known as the Moho).
      We have developed a method and software to estimate Moho depth from
      gravity data in
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw390">Uieda & Barbosa (2017)</a>,
      along with estimated values for South American and the adjacent oceans.

## About us

The **CompGeoLab** is a research group based at the
[{{ config.location.university }}][usp], Brazil.
We are experts in solving **inverse problems** in the field of **Geophysics**,
particularly in **gravity and magnetic methods** (AKA potential-field methods).
For example, determining the inner density distribution of the Earth from
measured disturbances in the Earth's gravity field.
These are the main tools used by geoscientists to **image the inside** of the
Earth and other planets.

We also specialize in building **open-source scientific software**.
Our team works on several tools and projects, both developing
tools in-house and contributing across the larger scientific ecosystem:

* [**Fatiando a Terra**][fatiando]: A collection of Python tools for
  geophysics. The Fatiando tools are the heart of most of our research and
  teaching efforts. This is the main project on which we work.
* [**xlandsat**][xlandsat]: A small Python library for loading and analyzing
  Landsat scenes downloaded from [USGS EarthExplorer][explorer] with the power
  of xarray into [xarray][xarray].
* [**The Generic Mapping Tools**][gmt]: One of the most widely used and loved
  open-source software in the geosciences. Our team contributes to both GMT and
  the [PyGMT][pygmt] library which brings all the power of GMT to the
  Scientific Python ecosystem.
* [**Tesseroids**][tesseroids]: A collection of command-line programs for
  modeling the gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor.
  Tesseroids supports models and computation grids in Cartesian and spherical
  coordinates.

Bottom right are two maps of South America, one colored green to yellow representing the Moho depth, larger around the Andes and smaller in towards the Atlantic coast, the other has scattered colored dots showing larger differences in the Andes and smaller elsewhere." ) }}

## About us

The **CompGeoLab** is a
[research group]({{ macros.pretty_relative_link(site["team/index"], page) }})
based at the
[{{ config.location.university }}][usp], Brazil.
We are experts in solving **inverse problems** in the field of **Geophysics**,
particularly in **gravity and magnetic methods** (AKA potential-field methods).
Inverse problems are the means by which geoscientists **image the inside** of
the Earth and other planets.
For example, we are able to determine the inner density distribution of the
Earth from measured disturbances in the Earth's gravity field.
We are also champions of **open science** and **reproducible research**.
All of our teaching and research efforts are symbiotic with the development of
**open source software** for geoscience.

Bottom left is a spherical 8-sided prism on top of the globe with white lines showing how it's broken up irregularly. Bottom right are two maps of South America, one colored green to yellow representing the Moho depth, larger around the Andes and smaller in towards the Atlantic coast, the other has scattered colored dots showing larger differences in the Andes and smaller elsewhere." ) }}


## Open source

Our team works on several tools and projects, both developed in-house and
across the larger scientific ecosystem:

* [**Fatiando a Terra**][fatiando]: A collection of Python tools for
  geophysics. The Fatiando tools are the heart of most of our research and
  teaching efforts. This is the main project on which we work.
* [**xlandsat**][xlandsat]: A small Python library for loading and analyzing
  Landsat scenes downloaded from [USGS EarthExplorer][explorer] with the power
  of xarray into [xarray][xarray].
* [**The Generic Mapping Tools**][gmt]: One of the most widely used and loved
  open-source software in the geosciences. Our team contributes to both GMT and
  the [PyGMT][pygmt] library which brings all the power of GMT to the
  Python stack.
* [**Tesseroids**][tesseroids]: A collection of command-line programs for
  modeling the gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor.
  Tesseroids supports models and computation grids in Cartesian and spherical
  coordinates.

We also **publish all of the code and data** needed to reproduce our projects
on [our GitHub organization][github].

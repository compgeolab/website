# How we communicate

We use a mix of communication channels that meet different needs:
ephemeral, archived, immediate, and asynchronous.

* **Slack:** We have a slack team at
  [compgeolab.slack.com](https://compgeolab.slack.com). You should receive an
  invitation when you join the group. This is the primary mode of communication
  for quick messages, announcements, reminders, and organizing meetings. Messages
  are ephemeral so you cannot count of being able to read messages older than 6
  months! Use email if you need a record of the conversation.
* **GitHub:** Each project will be assigned a repository on our [group GitHub
  account](https://github.com/compgeolab). Reviews of code, text, etc will be done
  through the repository. We'll also use to set goals and tasks.
* **Google Calendar:** The group calendar is used by everyone to post their
  travel and out-of-office dates, interesting conferences, talks, meeting
  times, etc. Lab visitors will be listed there as well.
* **Group meetings:** We will have *short* weekly group meetings for quick
  updates from everyone, general discussion, announcements, interesting papers,
  and informal chat. Updates from each group member will cover simple bullet
  points of what has been done in the previous period ( things you've worked on,
  things you've learned, struggles you're having, and so on).
* **Individual meetings:** We aim to have weekly individual meetings to discuss
  each members status, goals, projects, and work through problems and ideas.

Group members are also strongly encouraged to have in-person meetings with each
other or with Leo. Don't wait until problems build up to seek guidance.

# Detail level during group meetings

During the group meetings, detail should be just enough and no more to
communicate your work, unless probed by another group member. Longer
discussions can happen after the meeting with the participation of whoever is
interested. As the group grows larger, we need to ensure that everyone has an
opportunity to share. Detailed updates can be sent through Slack, or during
other chats or meetings.

For level of detail, it is fair to assume a passing familiarity with your
project and problems, but it is important to first look online to find if there
are common answers to issues you are encountering.

# Website

The source code used to generate this website is stored in a GitHub repository:
[compgeolab/website](https://github.com/compgeolab/website).
Members are expected to post **short** news items when they do things of note
(join the group, graduation, publication, conferences, awards, etc),
as well as to update project and publication information.
All updates are conducted via pull request.

When joining the group, please submit a pull request adding yourself to the
website. If you are new to git, you will work through this with someone more
experienced. You are **not** required to provide a photo and contact
information (but you certainly may if you feel comfortable having this
information public on the internet).

# Social media

In general, social media can be freely used if in line with the
[University of Liverpool Social Media Policy](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/computingservices/regulations/social-media-policy.pdf).
Lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind while participating if
they are representing themselves as lab members. Earlier comments about
professionalism apply here when lab members are presenting themselves as
representatives of the lab.

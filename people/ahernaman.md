# About

Lecturer in Geophysics at the
[Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/leonardo-uieda/)
of the University of Liverpool, UK.

My research focuses on inverse problems in potential field
geophysics with a heavy dose of open-source software development.
I do my best to bring more openness to the scientific process
and to train the next generation of scientists in the best practices of
reproducible computational experiments.
I'm also fairly active in social media, mostly
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/leouieda)
and the [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/).

Along with my role at the University, I'm also a
[Topic Editor for the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/),
a member of the [Advisory Council for EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/),
and
a [Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute][/news/ssi-fellowship].

Before coming to Liverpool, I was a Visiting Researcher at the University of
Hawai'i, USA, where I worked on the <a
href="https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org">Generic Mapping Tools</a> (GMT), a
widely-used software for processing and visualizing geophysical data. My main
contributions were the development of [PyGMT](https://www.pygmt.org) and
modernizing the team's development process (moving to GitHub, starting a
Discourse forum, setting up continuous-integration, etc). Prior to Hawai'i, I
worked for three years as Assistant Professor of Geophysics at the Universidade
do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

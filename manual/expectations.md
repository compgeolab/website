title: Expectations
---

We intend to foster a collegial lab atmosphere, with opportunities for
spontaneous discussions and creative opportunities.
A large part of that is taking care of our mental well-being:

* Lab members are **not** expected to sacrifice personal or leisure time in
  service of projects.
* Working long hours without interruption can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and
  overall **impedes** the type of atmosphere we are trying to develop.

We strive to be a part of the intellectual community at our host universities.
As such, lab members should endeavor to be good university "citizens",
including:

* Participating in department seminars and all-hands meetings.
* Contributing to department projects (research, teaching, and outreach).
* Collaborating with individuals from other groups around campus.
* Fostering new collaborations, both internally and externally.

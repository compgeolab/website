# Project: Improving estimates of Antarctic geothermal heat flow from geophysical data

The flow of heat coming from the Earth's interior is an important parameter for
how ice sheets flow and deform. It also plays a key role in determining how the
Earth's crust rebounds upwards once ice mass is displaced, influencing our
estimates of sea-level rise.
Geophysicists can indirectly determine heat flow from the measurements of
anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field due to magnetized rocks in the crust.
These data allow us to estimate the depth at which magnetic minerals lose their
magnetic properties, which happens at a particular temperature known as the
Curie temperature.
However, there are still some unknown factors about the limitations of this
technique.

The goals of this project are to:

1. Quantify the effect of merging magnetic data from different surveys (needed
   for continental-scale studies) due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field
   and crustal magnetization.
2. Produce an integrated magnetic data compilation for Antarctica that is less
   dependent on the direction of the Earth's field using state-of-the-art
   processing methods.
3. Estimate the depth to the Curie isotherm in Antarctica using the newly
   generated magnetic data.

The magnetic data integration and Curie depth estimation will be done by
adapting [methods][/publications/eql-gradient-boosted] and [software][/software]
recently developed by the research group and our international collaborators at
the [PINGA lab](https://www.pinga-lab.org) (for example,
[Hidalgo-Gato et al., 2021](https://www.pinga-lab.org/papers/mag-amp-basement2020.html),
and [Reis et al., 2020](https://www.pinga-lab.org/papers/generalized-positivity.html)).
By achieving these goals, we hope to quantify and reduce the uncertainty in the
Curie isotherm depth estimates for Antarctica, which is a key parameter in
determining geothermal heat flow in Antarctica.

# The supervisory team

You will be working with an international team of researchers:

* [Leonardo Uieda][/people/uieda] (me) as the primary advisor.
* [Richard Holme](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/richard-holme/),
  also from the University of Liverpool.
* [Vanderlei Coelho Oliveira Jr.](https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/oliveira-jr.html)
  from the [PINGA lab](https://www.pinga-lab.org) at the [Observatório Nacional, Brazil](https://on.br).

# Why work with us

Through this PhD, you will acquire the mathematical and Python programming
skills required to undertake the project. You will be trained to develop
software in a collaborative environment using GitHub and the current best
practices in research software engineering.

The project will be conducted following the current established norms of
open-science and reproducible research, with all outputs published on the
[group's GitHub page](https://github.com/compgeolab).

The project also has the potential to involve code contributions to the
different open-source Python [software developed by the research
group][/software], mainly [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org), leading
to potential impact beyond standard scientific publications.

# What we are looking for

This position would suit someone with skills in (or who is willing to learn):

* Computer programming (any language)
* Mathematics (linear algebra and calculus)
* Numerical methods

An ideal candidate would also be motivated, able to self-study, and interested
in open-science practices and open-source software.

# The position

This position is for a Graduate Teaching Assistant at 0.5 full-time employment
(FTE) over a 5 year period.

The role includes:

* Supporting the programme of practical exercises in physical geography,
  geospatial data analysis (geographical information systems), earth surface
  processes and dynamics, and environmental sciences.
* No less than 50% of your time for the pursuit of your PhD studies.

This project is one of eight eligible for funding support through the
recruitment of two GTAs within Geography & Planning and Earth Sciences.
The funding covers:

* Tuition fees.
* Research support budget £1000 per year.
* University Teacher Salary (£29,177 - £33,797 / year at 0.5 FTE pro rata)

Applicants are encouraged to read the [lab manual][/manual] to familiarize
themselves with the way we approach science, expectations, our code of conduct,
etc.

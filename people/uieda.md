# About

I am Lecturer in Geophysics at the Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences of
the University of Liverpool, UK.
My research focuses on inverse problems in potential field
geophysics with a heavy dose of open-source software development.
I do my best to bring more openness to the scientific process
and to train the next generation of scientists in the best practices of
reproducible computational experiments.

In the spirit of open-science,
I share all of the research and
teaching material online under permissive licenses.
You'll find links to source code, images, lessons, etc,
throughout my [personal website](http://www.leouieda.com).

Follow me on [Twitter (@leouieda)](https://twitter.com/leouieda)
and [Github (@leouieda)](https://github.com/leouieda)
for updates on teaching and research, random things from the world of academia,
etc.

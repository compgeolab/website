    Gravity data are among the most widely used means of investigating the
    depth to the crust-mantle boundary (known as the Moho).
    We have developed a method and software to estimate Moho depth from
    gravity data in
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw390">Uieda & Barbosa (2017)</a>,
    along with estimated values for South American and the adjacent oceans.

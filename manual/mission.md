## Support our team

* Small team
* Time for making personal connections
* Support career goals, whatever they may be

## Build solid foundations

* Build well-designed and robust software tools to provide the foundations for
  the geophysics community
* Doing things the hard way to learn instead of easy shortcuts

## Foster curiosity and broad interests

* Everyone should know what each are doing
* Help in each others projects
* Collaborate widely
* Research is not a zero-sum game

## Value the natural world

* Advocate for systemic change in our energy production and our reliance on
  fossil fuels in public forums and professional societies.
* Minimize the environmental impact of our research by seeking computational
  and energy efficiency in our methods.

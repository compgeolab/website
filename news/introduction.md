title: Introducing the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab

In August 2019, I started a new position as Lecturer in Geophysics at the
[University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/).
As part of this transition, I've had to think about my research in a broader context and
analyse what sets it apart.
Since [the lab's research](/research) will mainly focus on method development,
the range of actual scientific applications that we could potentially work on is broad.
Unfortunately, this makes coming up with a lab name rather difficult.

The constant thing throughout my career has been the fact that "computational thinking"
is at the heart of everything I do:
from [potential-field inversion](/research) to
[forward modeling](/research).
After much brainstorming, *"Computer-Oriented Geoscience"* seems to accurately describe
the type of research we do here:
**we apply computational methods to solve problems in geoscience**.

As a direct consequence, we also develop and maintain
[several open-source projects](/software) that supports our research and implement the
methods that we develop.
Our language of choice is Python and we have years of expertise in modern and
collaborative software development.
We are a [small group](/people) at the moment (only 2 members) but I'm hoping to grow
with time.

This website serves as a [portfolio of our research](/research) and also as a guide for
members and collaborators.
We are strong believers that the scientific process needs to be more open,
collaborative, reproducible, and inclusive.
As such, we have high expectations not only for the results of our work, but also for
how it is done.
Our [lab manual](https://github.com/compgeolab/manual) provides detailed
information, like our code of conduct and
what collaborators can expect from us (and what we expect from them).
The manual is based on the excellent [Lab Carpentry](http://labcarpentry.org/)
blueprints.

We are eager to establish collaborations with applied scientists who have interesting
problems that could benefit from our computational and numerical modeling skills.

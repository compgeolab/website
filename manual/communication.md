How we communicate in the lab and policies for external engagement when
representing the lab.

</div>

## Within the lab

* **Chat:** We have a lab chat room on the [Software Underground's Mattermost server](https://mattermost.softwareunderground.org/).
  This is the **primary mode of communication** for quick messages, announcements,
  reminders, and organizing meetings. Messages can be ephemeral so you cannot
  count of being able to read messages forever. **Use email if you need a
  record of the conversation.**
* **GitHub:** Each project is assigned a repository on our
  [GitHub account](https://github.com/compgeolab/).
  Reviews of code, text, etc., will be done through the repository. We'll also
  use to set goals and tasks.
* **Group meetings:** We will have weekly group meetings for quick updates from
  everyone, general discussion, announcements, interesting papers, etc. These
  meetings are important to keep everyone in the lab aware of what each of us
  are doing.
* **Individual meetings:** We aim to have *short* weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly
  (depending on your preference) individual meetings to discuss project status,
  personal and professional goals, work through problems, and to build a good
  supervisor-student relationship.
* Group members are also encouraged to have meetings and messages with each
  other. **Don't wait until problems build up to seek guidance.**

## Using our website

* Source code used to generate the website:
  [compgeolab/website](https://github.com/compgeolab/website).
* Members are expected to post **short** news items when they do things of note
  (join the group, graduation, publication, conferences, awards, etc), as well
  as to update project and publication information.
* When joining the group, please submit a pull request adding yourself to the
  website. You are **not** required to provide a photo and contact information
  (but you certainly may if you feel comfortable having this information public
  on the internet).

## Social media

* Lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind while participating in
  social media. **If you are representing yourself as a lab member, the lab
  {{ macros.page_link("manual/coc", page, site) }} applies!**

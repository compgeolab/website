## About

This document is designed to be a reference for lab members and collaborators.
It's also part of an induction process when people join the lab.
**The manual is a living document.** Lab members are **encouraged to submit
fixes and improvements** to it. See the
[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/compgeolab/website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for this website to find out how.

**Want to work with us?**
Before applying to join the lab or starting a collaboration, please
read {{ macros.page_link("manual/open-science", page, site) }} and
{{ macros.page_link("manual/authorship", page, site) }}.
These sections outline our core principles as scientists and it's important
that you are aware of and agree with these principles to a large extent.

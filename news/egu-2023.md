Today, lab member [Gelson F. Souza Junior](../team#Souza-junior) will give a
presentation at the EGU 2023 General Assembly about our initial results
adapting applied geophysics methods to magnetic microscopy data developed under
our [Royal Society grant](rsoc-mag-microscopy-2022.html) and Gelson's PhD,
which is funded by [FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/).
Here's a sneak peek of one of the results that Gelson will be presenting:

The talk is **today** Wednesday 26 April 2023 at **15:05** (Vienna time) in
**Room -2.21** as part of session
[EMRP3.1 - Paleomagnetism, micromagnetism and magnetic fabrics: Recent advances and geological applications](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/session/45916).

## Abstract

Classically, paleomagnetic data is obtained from bulk samples, where the signal
is obtained from the sum of all magnetic moments within the sample volume. This
typically includes stable and unstable remanence carriers. With the advance of
microscope imaging techniques (e.g., SQUID microscopes, Quantum Diamond
Microscopes) it is now possible to spatially isolate the contribution of single
grains or clusters of grains. Yet, despite recent advances in the inversion
techniques to derive full vector information from the magnetic microscopy data,
there is still no inversion protocol capable of obtaining the magnetization
directions of each magnetic particle without using a priori information or
physically separating the spatial position of each anomaly. Here we present an
algorithm capable of automatically identifying the position of each magnetic
anomaly source by combining signal processing and tridimensional Euler
deconvolution. Subsequently, we recover both the direction and the intensity of
the magnetic moment of each magnetic source with no need for any kind of
additional information. The method presented here is a potential technique that
may help increase the statistical accuracy of data obtained in paleomagnetic
studies from magnetic microscopy data, especially in the case of complex
characteristic remanent magnetization.

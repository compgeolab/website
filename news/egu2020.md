This week, the [EGU 2020 General Assembly](https://www.egu2020.eu/) has been
happening online for the first time. Instead of the traditional presentations,
authors were asked to submit slides/videos/posters and then participated on a
live chat room to pitch their projects and answer questions from the audience.

Both [Leo](/team) and [Santiago](/team) had presentations
in session [G4.3: Acquisition and processing of gravity and magnetic field data
and their integrative
interpretation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/displays/35332).
You can view their abstracts and slides as well as leave comments on the
conference website until the end of May 2020.
In case the slides are no longer available through EGU, they have also been
uploaded to [figshare](https://figshare.com/) (see links below).

Both presentations investigate improvements to equivalent layer/source
processing, which is a powerful technique to process and grid gravity and
magnetic data. The improvements are being directly implemented in the Python
software [Verde](https://www.fatiando.org/verde) and
[Harmonica](https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica).


## A better strategy for interpolating gravity and magnetic data

> We present a new strategy for gravity and magnetic data interpolation and
> processing. Our method is based on the equivalent layer technique (EQL) and
> produces more accurate interpolations when compared with similar EQL methods.
> It also reduces the computation time and memory requirements, both of which
> have been severe limiting factors.

## Evaluating the accuracy of equivalent-source predictions using cross-validation

> We investigate the use of cross-validation (CV) techniques to estimate the
> accuracy of equivalent-source (also known as equivalent-layer) models for
> interpolation and processing of potential-field data. Our preliminary results
> indicate that some common CV algorithms (e.g., random permutations and
> k-folds) tend to overestimate the accuracy. We have found that blocked CV
> methods, where the data are split along spatial blocks instead of randomly,
> provide more conservative and realistic accuracy estimates. Beyond evaluating
> an equivalent-source model's performance, cross-validation can be used to
> automatically determine configuration parameters, like source depth and
> amount of regularization, that maximize prediction accuracy and avoid
> over-fitting.

It's also part of an induction process when people join the lab.
**The manual is a living document.** Lab members are **encouraged to submit
fixes and improvements** to it. See the

**Want to work with us?**
Before applying to join the lab or starting a collaboration, please

These sections outline our core principles as scientists and it's important
that you are aware of and agree with these principles to a large extent.

title: Our mission
---

<div class="lead">

We seek to **advance our knowledge of geophysics** through the
application of computational methods to solve problems in data processing,
integration, and modeling.
Our efforts to fulfil our mission are **guided by the following values**.

</div>

## Support our team

* Small team
* Time for making personal connections
* Support career goals, whatever they may be

## Build solid foundations

* We firmly believe that humanity can reach higher while standing on the
  shoulders of those who came before us.
* Build well-designed and robust software tools to provide the foundations for
  the geophysics community
* Doing things the hard way to learn instead of easy shortcuts

## Foster curiosity and broad interests

* Everyone should know what each are doing
* Help in each others projects
* Collaborate widely
* Research is not a zero-sum game

## Value the natural world

* Advocate for systemic change in our energy production and our reliance on
  fossil fuels in public forums and professional societies.
* Minimize the environmental impact of our research by seeking computational
  and energy efficiency in our methods.
* Limit and carefully consider receiving funds from the fossil fuel industry
  unless the project explicitly contributes to a reduction in fossil fuel
  production.

title: Code of Conduct
---

<div class="lead">

All **members of the lab**, along with **visitors and collaborators**, are
expected to abide by the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code
as needed and we expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a **safe
environment for everybody**.

</div>

## The Quick Version

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack
thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab
meetings, presentations, or discussions.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event. We
expect members to treat each other professionally with respect to their work,
with constructive criticism and without dismissive behavior (e.g., eye
rolling).

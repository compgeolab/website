From February 17 to 21, 2025, the **[XXVII Geophysics Summer School](https://www.iag.usp.br/eventos/curso-extensao-escola-verao-2025) at [IAG - USP](https://www.iag.usp.br/)** took place, offering an intense week of learning, knowledge exchange, and the development of essential skills for scientific research. Under the instruction of [Leo](../team#leouieda), [Arthur](../team#arthursmacedo), and [myself](../team#YagoMCastro), participants had the opportunity to explore some of the fundamental tools for efficient and reproducible scientific workflows: Bash, Git, GNU Make, and LaTeX.  

In addition to the technical content, the course provided a valuable space for networking and discussions, strengthening the academic community and fostering new collaborations. The participants' feedback was highly positive, highlighting the quality of the materials, the dedication of the team, and the interactive nature of the activities.  

## My experience as a teaching assistant

Serving as a teaching assistant in the course was both a challenging and rewarding experience. Supporting participants with their questions, assisting in practical activities, and contributing to the course organization provided a new perspective on the teaching and learning process. It was a valuable opportunity to develop pedagogical skills, work with diverse student profiles, and deepen my own knowledge in the field.  

We sincerely thank everyone who participated and contributed to the success of the event! Below is a special snapshot of our group during the course.

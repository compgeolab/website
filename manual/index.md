The lab manual has moved to
[github.com/compgeolab/manual](https://github.com/compgeolab/manual)

It is designed to be a reference for lab members and collaborators as well as
part of an induction process when people join the lab. The manual outlines our
practices, core principals, ethics, and expectations.
